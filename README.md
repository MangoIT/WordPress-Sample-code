WordPress-Sample-code
=====================

- Membership Plugin: It provides custom registration and login forms. It uses short code to disply the form on WordPress pages. Short code will generate forms on the required pages instead of WordPress default form.

- Originoal Plugin: We have used this plugins for custom post type to display the details of the post type original. All the WodPress default functions like manage category and tags were used to categorize the posts. There are seperate category and tag pages to display the post accordingly. 

We have also added some custom metaboxes to add additional information for a soecific post. Details of the post displayed by the custom scripts and as per the user requirement.
